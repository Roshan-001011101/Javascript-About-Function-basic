WHAT ARE FUNCTIONS?
Functions are basically the control of all procedures working under the bracket {}.
It consists of two or more arguments (integers or strings) which shows the program that the code is related to these parameters and thus helps the program to execute the function.
The function consists of () in which the code is implemented so that the code inside the function ()can be executed.
Create a output variable and store the result in it.

SOME EXAMPLES.....

Q1.Create a function and implement the sum of two integers within those brackets and execute the function!!

function input(x,y){
var a=x;
var b=y;
var sum=(x+y);

var s=(sum);
return s;
}
input();
